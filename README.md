# WiFi Router Placement Optimizer

An algorithmic solution to minimize the number of WiFi routers required to ensure complete coverage of connected rooms, using **graph theory** and a **greedy Set Cover Approximation**.

---

## Problem Statement

You are given:
- A list of rooms with their area sizes.
- A maximum range a WiFi router can cover based on total area.

**Goal:**  
Place the **minimum number of routers** such that all rooms are covered.  
A router placed in a room can cover it and its adjacent rooms, as long as the total area does not exceed the router's range.

---

## Approach & Algorithms Used

This problem is modeled as a **graph coverage optimization problem** and solved using:
- **Graph Representation** via Adjacency List
- **Breadth-First Search (BFS)** to detect reachable rooms under area constraints
- **Greedy Set Cover Approximation** to iteratively pick the best placement

---

## Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) Used

- Graph traversal: **BFS**
- Greedy Algorithm: **Set Cover Approximation**
- STL containers:
  - `std::vector` â€” graph and area storage
  - `std::queue` â€” BFS traversal
  - `std::set` â€” track reachable & covered rooms
- File I/O with `std::ifstream` / `ofstream`

##  How to Build & Run

### Prerequisites
- C++ compiler (g++)
- MSYS2 (on Windows)
- OpenGL + GLUT installed

### Build
Run from the project root:

```bash
make
```

This will create:
- `bin/main` â€” runs the optimization algorithm
- `bin/vis` â€” launches the OpenGL visualizer

---

###  Run

Prepare your input data in `data/input.txt`.  
Run the optimizer:

```
./bin/main
```

View the results in the visualizer:

```
./bin/vis
```

<Area_1> <Area_2> ... <Area_n>
<Number of Edges>
<Room_u1> <Room_v1>
<Room_u2> <Room_v2>
...
```

##  Visualization

- Rooms are displayed as rectangles using OpenGL.
- **Green:** rooms where routers are placed.
- **Light blue:** rooms covered by those routers.
- Each room is labeled with its ID for clarity.
